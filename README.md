- [Amber](https://github.com/EgeBalci/amber/releases)

It enables stealthy in-memory payload deployment that can be used to bypass anti-virus, firewall, IDS, IPS products, and application white-listing mitigations. Reflective payloads generated by Amber can either be staged from a remote server or executed directly in memory much like a generic shellcode. By default, every generated payload is encoded using the new generation SGN encoder. Amber uses CRC32_API and IAT_API for inconspicuously resolving the Windows API function addresses. After the PE file is loaded and executed in memory, the reflective payload is erased for evading memory scanners.

- PINdemonium
- PolyUnpack

  From Renovo paper: PolyUnpack is a general approach for extracting the original hidden code without any heuristic assumptions. PolyUnpack takes advantage of the intrinsic nature of packed executables where the hidden code is generated and executed at run-time, and thus it is not present in the code section of the packed executable. As a pre-analysis step, PolyUnpack disassembles the packed executable to partition it into the code and data sections, Then it executes the binary instruction by instruction, checking whether the instruction sequence from the current point is in the code section identified in the pre-analysis step. The authors have implemented this approach and have shown that it can successfully identify and extract the hidden code in malware samples in the wild. However, in terms of performance, disassembling a program and single-step executing a binary significantly increase the computational complexity of its analysis.

- [RapidEXE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rapidexe/)

  RapidEXE is a simple and efficient way to convert your script to a standalone executable. You can create command line tools with all the power of modern scripting languages and share it with others, even if they don't have the runtime environment.


- [RDG Packer Detector](http://www.rdgsoft.net/)
- REMINDer
- Renovo

  Built on top of TEMU (dynamic analysis component of BitBlaze)
  Its basic idea is to detect the execution of newly-generated code by monitoring memory writes after the program starts. It maintains a shadow memory and flags each byte with 0 (clean) or 1 (dirty). It combines two main component ; the Execution Monitor and the Extraction Engine.
  Advantages of its approach :
  - we assume nothing about the packing methods (cfr problem with signatures)
  - can determine the exact memory regions accommodating the code or data generated at run-time (cfr dynamic analysis)
  -  does not rely on any information on the code and data sections of the binary (on the contrary of static analysis and some approaches of dynamic analysis)
  This approach can handle multi-layers packing.


- [RetDec](https://github.com/avast/retdec/releases)

  RetDec is a retargetable machine-code decompiler based on LLVM.
  The decompiler is not limited to any particular target architecture, operating system, or executable file format:
  - Supported file formats: ELF, PE, Mach-O, COFF, AR (archive), Intel HEX, and raw machine code
  - Supported architectures:
    * 32-bit: Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, PIC32, and PowerPC
    * 64-bit: x86-64, ARM64 (AArch64)


- SymPack
- [Unipacker](https://github.com/unipacker/unipacker)
- [UnpacMe](https://www.unpac.me/#/)

  UNPACME is an automated malware unpacking service. Submissions to UNPACME are analyzed using a set of custom unpacking processes maintained by OpenAnalysis. These processes extract all encrypted or packed payloads from the submission and return a unique set of payloads to the user. In short, UNPACME automates the first step in your malware analysis process.

  This identifies packed executables and their OEP by using several heuristics.
  Universal PE Unpacker assumes that GetProcAddress is always called to setup the import table after the original program is unpacked and before the program counter reaches the OEP.
  It is not intended to be an automated unpacking tool because it must be given a priori knowledge about the the possible range of the OEP.


- [Uunp (IDA Pro plugin)](https://www.hex-rays.com/blog/unpacking-mpressed-pe-dlls-with-the-bochs-plugin/)

  Universal PE unpacker debugger plug-in module automates the analysis and unpacking of packed binaries. This plug-in uses the debugger to let the program unpack itself in memory and as soon as the execution reaches the original entry point, it suspends the program. The user may then take a memory snapshot.
